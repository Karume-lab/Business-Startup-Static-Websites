			<h1 class="underline text-center text-3xl">About Farm2U</h1>
			<p>
				Farm2U is an innovative platform that aims to reduce food waste,
				promote sustainability, and connect communities through the concept of food sharing.
				Our mission is to create a more efficient and equitable food system by enabling
				individuals and businesses to share their surplus food with those in need.
				At Farm2U, we believe that no food should go to waste when there are people
				who can benefit from it. We provide a user-friendly online platform where
				individuals, restaurants, grocery stores, and other food-related businesses
				can list their excess or near-expiry food items. These items can include fresh
				produce, packaged goods, baked goods, and more.
				Our platform connects food donors with local charitable organizations, community
				centers, and individuals who can benefit from the surplus food. By facilitating
				these connections, we aim to address food insecurity and promote sustainable
				practices by diverting perfectly good food from ending up in landfills.
